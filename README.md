# 3d-vs-1d-synthesis
A study on the impact of different methods to produce the high-frequency component of synthetic speech spectra.


# Stimuli generation
## Settings for VocalTractLab transfer function calculation:
Radiation impedance: Piston in wall
Additional options: all OFF
Energy losses: Boundary layer resistance ON, heat conduction losses ON, Soft Walls ON, Hagen-Poiseuille resistance OFF
## Baseline stimuli 
The full-bandwidth transfer functions calculated using the multimodal method are used to produce the baseline stimuli.
