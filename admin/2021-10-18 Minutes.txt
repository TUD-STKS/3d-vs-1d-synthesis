Meeting on October 18th, 2021

1. New stimuli generation using natural reference values for f0 and envelope is OK.

2. Metallic noise in BWE stimuli is due to the methods themselves. The BWE modality is therefore just a kind of "control" modality that shows that it matters what happens in the high frequency range. 

3. Stimuli are now final.

4. Results of pretests regarding the interface revealed that the pretest was not done on the final interface version.

5. Rémi showed the current interfaces of the two tasks and collected feedback to further improve the interface.



To Do:
Rémi sends final stimuli to Angélique after checking the loudness normalization.
Rémi incorporates the feedback into the interfaces for the two tasks. He then sends it to Angélique for a round of feedback from just Angélique and Camille and then another pretest.
Rémi finalizes the result file format.

Next meeting:
November 3rd, 2 pm
