Comparison VTL 1D vs. 3D

5 vowels VVTF: /a/, /e/, /i/, /o/, /u/ (Mostly the same across multiple languages)
5 from male, 5 from female vocal tract model
=> 10 in total

Side cavities removed in both methods! 
Adapt 1d vocal tract shape to match formants of 3d multimodal method's formants.

2 experiments:

3 conditions:
1: 3d multimodal method up to 10 kHz
2: 1d VocalTractLab method, bandlimited to 5 kHz and then extended with BWE
3: 1d VocalTractLab method up to 10 kHz (including physically incorrect formants >5kHz).

Generation of the excitation:
KLGLOTT88 model
Pitch-synchronous noise bursts (with high-pass filtered spectrum)
Research some BWE algorithm that allows TF extension.
3 voice qualities: 
(b)reathy, (m)odal, (p)ressed

********************
Possible research questions (details will be defined once we have listened to some examples):
Pre-test: Is the difference between stimuli obvious?

Experiment A: 
Q: Is there a perceptible difference between 3d-fullBw, 1d-BWE, 1d-VTL
Design:
10 vowels -> 60 pairs (1 vs 1, 1 vs 2, 1 vs 3, 2 vs 3, 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3) per voice quality
Experiment is run three times, once for each voice quality.

Experiment B:
Q: Is 3d-fullBw or 1d-BWE or 1d-VTL prefered

Next steps:
Peter adapts geometries to compensate the missing side cavities (by April 7)
RÃ©mi generates 3d simulations based on shapes w/o side cavities (by April 9)
Simon adapts shapes w/o side cavities to match 3d formants (by April 13)
Next meeting: April 20, 9 am (https://meet.jit.si/3d-synthesis-vs-1d)
