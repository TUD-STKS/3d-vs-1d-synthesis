Meeting on October 4th, 2021

0. New female /e/ stimuli are accepted ("tongue2")
1. Rémi shared a presentation on the methods of the study (slide deck in the repo)
	Potentially possible to measure up to 20 kHz with a borrowed audiometer
	But BWE can only go up to 16 kHz
	Due to AA concerns in the BWE process and the rating of the used audiometer (up to 12.25 kHz) we will go with 12 kHz as the upper limit
	
	Exp 1: Do not include "none" option
	Exp 2: Use a 0-100 slider instead of 5-point scale
	
2. Rémi noted that the level of the HF content in all stimuli is much lower than in natural speech
	Peter suggested to acknowledge this problem but accept it for the purposes of our study

3. Female /o/ had many confusions with /u/
	Create better /o/

4. Sound duration
	Get timing and f0 contour from a natural sample

To Do:
Simon will copy duration and f0 from a 2 to 3 samples of his own speech. Scale f0 up for female voice. Target: 8. October
Rémi will improve the /o/ and improve the experimental interface(s).

Next meeting:
