Making of the stimuli
- Offset of the phase of the transfer functions of 1.5 is suspicious -> Does not seem to occur when using the VTL GUI export.
- Offset is present in both 1d and MM transfer functions
- 1d transfer function phase has about twice the slope of the phase of the MM TF

Simon:
- Find out why the phase of the transfer functions exported from VTL have an offset of 1.5

Remi:
- Look into two more papers suggested by Peter to find parameters for the three phonation types 
- Find out why the phase of the transfer functions of the multimodal method have an offset of 1.5 and an insufficient slope

Next meeting:
