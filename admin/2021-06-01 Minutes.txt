Transfer function generation:
Radiation from the mouth now calculated the same way for 1d and 3d transfer functions
Distance from the mouth now the same
To do: Create new stimuli

Excitation generation:
New parameters for LF model found in paper by Alku
Spectral slope not uniquely defined by the parameters from Alku 
-> Make educated guess about spectral slope and pick three sufficiently different values
Addition of noise to glottal flow implemented
-> Make educated about SNR
-> Low-pass filter noise part: Hillman - Characteristics of the glottal turbulent noise source

Next meeting: June 22, 8 am
