Final version of stimuli and interface accepted after feedback from Camille and Angélique.
Angélique has submitted the ethics committee application and taken care of the insurance.
Mr. Kaiser will be compensated for the calibration out of Rémi's grant budget (same as for the last study).

Originally, there was no plan to compensate the participants. 
Peter offers 800 EUR for compensation. Angélique will check if this requires changes to the ethics application.


Experimental setup:
Loudspeaker calibrated at 70 dB at distance of 1 m in front of the loudspeaker (= the position of the subjects).
1.5 hours per participant. 35 to 45 participants are planned.

Target start date:
End of January

Publication plan:
Journal article submission in April (to JASA? IEEE T-ASL?)
Simon and Rémi are starting the manuscript ASAP.

Statistical evaluation:
We will re-use the methods from the previous study but confirm with statisticians from the TUD.


To Do:
Rémi contacts Mr. Kaiser to discuss the loudspeaker calibration.
Angélique will do a pretest with Camille to finalize the experimental protocol.
After that, Angélique and Camille will start the subject recruitment and testing.
Simon and Rémi will start writing the article.
