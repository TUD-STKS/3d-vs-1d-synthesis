Comparison VTL 1D vs. 3D

8 vowels VVTF

2 experiments:

3 conditions:
1: 3d multimodal method
2: 3d multimodal method, bandlimited and then extended with BWE
3: 1d VocalTractLab method with adapted vocal tract shapes to match the 3d multimodal method formants.

Experiment A: 
Q: Is there an perceptible difference between 3d-fullBw, 1d-BWE, 1d-VTL

Experiment B:
Q: Is 3d-fullBw or 1d-BWE or 1d-VTL prefered

Generation of the excitation:
KLGLOTT88 model
Pitch-synchronous noise bursts (with high-pass filtered spectrum)
Research some BWE algorithm that allows TF extension.
