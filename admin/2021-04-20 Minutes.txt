Rémi:
	/o/ sound synthesis not yet possible because of branching where the tongue touches the uvula
	suggested workaround: Move tongue slightly so that it no longer touches the uvula
	
Simon: 
	Vocal tract shapes are adapted for everything except male /o/	
	Very little adaptation was necessary because the match was already very close
	But perceptually worse stimuli after synthesis
	MM stimuli sound better 
	-> Decrease bandwidth in MM transfer functions to reduce difference of the TF troughs!

Stimuli:
	female /i/ and /o/ are not clear
	impulse response is non-causal because of unknown (numerical?) issues
	window impulse response with a Hamming halfwindow?


To Do:
Simon: 
- Give Angelique access to the GitHub Repo
- Send out contrastive samples of sounds pre and post VT shape optimization
- Extending TF to full spectrum: Fade out frequencies to zero, add zeros to get to a power of 2

Rémi: 
- Modify the cross-section at the uvula to add a fistula between the two channels
- Decrease bandwidth of formants in MM transfer function to better match the troughs of the 1d TF
- Modify /o/ and /i/ to sound more accurately identifiable

Angelique:
- Modify /o/ and /i/ to sound more accurately identifiable
