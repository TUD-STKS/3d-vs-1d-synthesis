Observations:
- female /e/ sounds like /i/ and /o/ like /u/ for all three phonations
- breathy stimuli "extremely breathy"
- breathy versions using BWE sound more "integrated" than the MM_MM ones. The MM_MM ones sound almost like two distinct sound sources, which is probably due to the high energy in the high frequency range. 
-> Maybe the noise spectrum needs to have less high frequency content -> sharper filter

Experimental design:
- "Is there a difference?" not necessary, differences are pronounced enough
- "Which one sounds more natural?" 
    o Pair-wise comparison
    o Single stimulus Likert test rating naturalness -> essentially rating how well the synthesized vowel quality matches the listeners' expectations


To Do:
Fine tune the shapes manually to a obtain clearer distinction (RÃ©mi)
Design a filter that approximates the function -9.4 dB/kHz from the Hillman paper (Simon)

Next meeting: August 17, 4 pm (without Simon)
