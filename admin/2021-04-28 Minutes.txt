
Issue:
Which low-frequency part is "correct"? Should equal low-frequency components be enforced (formant values, bandwidths).

Suggestion:
Do frequency blending:
- C1: Use full band multimodal transfer function as baseline
- C2: Substitute high frequency components with 1d high frequency part
- C3: Substitute high frequency components with bandwidth extension
Experiment 1 - null-hypothesis: There is no perceptable difference depending on the generation method of the HF components.
Experiment 2 - Preference A/B experiment comparing the three conditions

Issue:
Level difference between 1d and 3d transfer functions

Suggestion:
Filter transfer functions (3d and 1d) to low-frequency part -> transform to impulse response -> calculate energy of ir -> calculate the ratio of energies -> use ratio in the frequency domain on the entire transfer function.


To Do:

RÃ©mi:
Export full transfer functions

Simon:
Window the transfer function's magnitude using a half cosine-tapered window instead of proper filter.
Blend 3d and 1d transfer functions around 10 kHz using same cosine-tapered window.
