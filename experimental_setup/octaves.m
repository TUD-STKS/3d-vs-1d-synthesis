function [ftable fm] = octaves(N,b,base)

% OCTAVES calculates the IEC standard octave band associated with the
% number N. 'b' is the 'bandwidth designator' or in other words the
% fraction of octaves desired (use 1 for octaves, 3
% for third octaves). The integer N determines the BAND DISTANCE FROM the
% 1000 HZ band (which is always N=30), which will vary for octaves and
% third octaves. For example, N=29 is one band BELOW the 1000 Hz band
% which would be the 500 Hz band for octaves, or the 794 Hz band for
% third octaves. When the bandwidth designator b=3, N is known as the
% 'band number'.
% The center frequencies are calculated according to 'base', which can be
% 2 or 10. (10 is preferred for the standard, but not required. 2 gives
% traditional audiometric octaves.)
%
% [ftable fm] = octaves(N,b,base)
% 'ftable' is a length(N) x 4 matrix. The first column contains the number
% association (N), the second is the center frequency, the third is the
% lower cutoff frequency, and the fourth is the upper cutoff frequency.
% ALL FREQUENCY VALUES ARE GIVEN IN KHZ.
% 'fm' is the center (or midband) frequency in kHz.
%
% The function is based on the IEC standard.
%
% Example:
% octanalysis = octaves(-3:4,1);
% (calculates octave bands from 125 Hz to 16 kHz)
% oct3analysis = octaves(-10:13,3);
% (calculates third-octave bands from 100 Hz to 20.2 kHz)
% switch baG = 10^(3/10); % for base 10 calculation
G = 2; % for base 2 calculation
% fr = 1000;
% according to IEC 1260:1995
% if mod(b,2)
% fm = (G.^(N/b));
% else
% fm = (G.^((2*N+1)/(2*b)));
% end
% according to ANSI S1.11-2004 (R2009)
% if b = 3 then N is considered the 'band number'
if mod(b,2)
fm = (G.^((N-30)/b));
else
fm = (G.^((2*N-59)/(2*b)));
end
f1 = (G^(-1/(2*b))).*fm;
f2 = (G^(1/(2*b))).*fm;
